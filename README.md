# Terraform Exporter for SAP BTP

## Overview
The *Terraform Exporter for SAP BTP* (btptf CLI) is a handy tool that makes it easier to bring your existing SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) resources into Terraform. With it, you can take things like subaccounts and directories in BTP and turn them into configuration files including the import of the state. It's especially useful for teams who are moving to Terraform but still need to manage older infrastructure or SAP BTP accounts that are already set up.

Here's how it works:

- **Resource Identification**: Terraform Exporter for SAP BTP identifies the SAP BTP resources and maps them to corresponding Terraform resources.
- **Import Process**: The tool uses Terraform's import function to create the import blocks required for the state import.
- **Configuration Generation**: It generates the Terraform code (in HashiCorp Configuration Language - HCL) for each resource, enabling further customizations as needed.

You can install btptf CLI across various operating systems as described below.
